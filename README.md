This Python script appears to be a web scraper that extracts content (text and images) from a given URL, analyzes the content, and writes the analysis results to a text file. Here's a brief breakdown of the functionality:

Libraries Used:

os: For operating system-related functionality.
requests: For making HTTP requests to the specified URL.
BeautifulSoup from bs4: For parsing HTML content.
urlparse from urllib.parse: For parsing URLs.
Functions:

analysis: Analyzes the extracted image URLs and link URLs, counts the occurrences of different image formats, and writes the analysis results to a text file.
image_download: Downloads images from the extracted image URLs and saves them to the specified output folder.
extract_content: Extracts text content, image URLs, and link URLs from the HTML content of a webpage using BeautifulSoup. Then, it calls the analysis function to perform analysis on the extracted data.
write_to_txt: Writes the extracted content to a text file.
main: The main function of the script. It initiates the process by sending an HTTP request to the specified URL, extracting content, and writing the extracted content to a text file.
Execution:

The script defines a main function which is executed if the script is run directly.
The main function sends an HTTP request to the URL specified (https://franchisesuppliernetwork.com), extracts content from the response, and writes it to a text file.
Output:

The output is saved in a folder named after the domain of the URL, under an 'output folder'. The extracted content is saved in a file named output_main.txt.
Additionally, images are downloaded and saved in a subfolder named 'images' within the domain folder.
Overall, the script is designed to scrape content from a webpage, analyze it, and save the results for further processing or analysis.
